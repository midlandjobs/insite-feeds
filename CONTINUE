we were on the validation part of the api build. the apu key is now being validated via the headers etc

i had been wondering about whether the basic validations done in local build fetchFeedJson() should also be done in the api build
validation shoulld always be done as early as possible, so the basic validations should be done BEFORE the proxy
and the proxy after that only validates the key / domain request etc, before returning any data
it would seem necessary for the php to retain the checks, at least if the request to php is not made via usual script, but like in the browser directly
but checking only the request header for a valid api key would be enough. 

we would be assuming in php by that stage, thaat the validatiions done in js would be enough 
the validations will ensure at least that everything is correctly formed, it wont ensure data is returned
so given that php always needs to return json, either error or data
we can first check the header for api key etc or return error json...
